# tornelib-php-feedagent

RSS- and HTTP feeding agent (collector). Using netcurl to fetch data from RSS and http feeds.

## A simple HTTP feed agent

This is a "feed agent" with the purpose to fetch data from different kind of feeds, not only RSS.

Laminas is used to fetch RSS feeds and since laminas requires at least PHP 7.3, I've set PHP 7.4 as lowest required version.
